The Maximum Entropy (Maxent) model (Phillips et al., 2008) is a popular machine-learning species distribution model that works on presence-only data.
This tool helps derive background data points as pseudoabsences;
prepares test and training datasets to check model precision;
provides codes to generate a bias file for bias correction;
compares model precisions using the null model
